Welcome!

In this project, I demonstrate proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques using a real-world data set from SpaceX!

Using data-driven insights and machine learning models, I predicted the success of first-stage rocket landings which is critical for cost-efficient reusable rockets. By analyzing SpaceX's groundbreaking advancements, including Falcon 9's reusable first stage, I also developed dashboards to estimate launch costs and optimize operations. This project reflects the intersection of innovation, data science, and space exploration, paving the way for affordable space travel! üåç‚ú®

I apply the skills I learned from my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate to perform data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization model development, and model evaluation. I entirely used Python code to create machine learning models including support vector machines, decision tree classifiers, and k-nearest neighbors and also created dash app to portray data insights. I evaluated the results of machine learning models for predictive analysis, compare their strengths and weaknesses and identify the optimal model.
