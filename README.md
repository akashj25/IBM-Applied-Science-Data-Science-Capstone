Welcome!

In this project, I demonstrate proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques using a real-world data set from SpaceX.  

I apply the skills I learned from my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate to perform data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization model development, and model evaluation. 

I entirely used Python code to create machine learning models including support vector machines, decision tree classifiers, and k-nearest neighbors and also created dash app to portray data insights. 

I finally evaluated the results of machine learning models for predictive analysis, compare their strengths and weaknesses and identify the optimal model.
